# Initial Concept
i am going to create a multi-screen application, where there will be a intro/hero screen, a space to generate an image using nano banana, a 2nd screen displaying that image and offering a 2nd prompt to edit, and then finally an interactive 3d environment (which is currently clostest to our default template that I've set up here.

## Target Users
- Creative professionals looking to generate and visualize 3D environments from images.
- Developers and enthusiasts exploring cutting-edge AI pipelines (Nano Banana, Marble World Labs, Decart Realtime).

## Core Vision
Genie is a high-fidelity AI-to-3D pipeline that transforms text prompts into immersive interactive environments. It leverages a sophisticated sequence of AI models: image generation via Nano Banana, Gaussian Splat conversion via Marble World Labs, and a final real-time AI polish layer via Decart Realtime API.

## Key Features
- **Hero Gallery:** An immersive intro screen showcasing community worlds with a clear path to start a new creation.
- **AI Pipeline Integration:**
    - **Nano Banana:** Initial image generation from text prompts.
    - **Review & Refine:** A dedicated interface to view generated images and iterate using prompt refinement.
    - **Marble World Labs:** Conversion of 2D imagery into high-quality 3D Gaussian Splats.
    - **Decart Realtime:** A real-time AI generation layer for visual polish and enhancement.
- **Interactive 3D Exploration:** First-person exploration of the generated splat scenes (already implemented in the core engine).

## Success Metrics
- Seamless transition between the generation stages and the final 3D environment.
- High visual fidelity and low-latency interaction in the final polished 3D scene.
